<p>I like the language JS very much. I feel that it is the same as the C language. In the C language, many things need to be implemented by ourselves, so that we can exert unlimited creativity and imagination. In JS, although many things have been provided in V8, but with JS, you can still create a lot of interesting things, as well as interesting writing methods.</p>
<p>In addition, JS should be the only language I have seen that does not implement network and file functions. Network and files are a very important ability, and for programmers, they are also very core and basic knowledge. Fortunately, Node.js was created. On the basis of JS, Node.js uses the capabilities provided by V8 and Libuv, which greatly expands and enriches the capabilities of JS, especially the network and files, so that I can not only use JS, you can also use functions such as network and files, which is one of the reasons why I gradually turned to Node.js, and one of the reasons why I started to study the source code of Node.js.</p>
<p>Although Node.js satisfies my preferences and technical needs, at the beginning, I did not devote myself to code research, but occasionally looked at the implementation of some modules. The real beginning was to do &quot;Node.js&quot;. .js is how to use Libuv to implement event loop and asynchrony”. Since then, most of my spare time and energy have been devoted to source code research.</p>
<p>I started with Libuv first, because Libuv is one of the core of Node.js. Since I have studied some Linux source code, and I have been learning some principles and implementations of the operating system, I did not encounter much difficulty when reading Libuv. The use and principles of C language functions can basically be understood. , the point is that each logic needs to be clearly defined.</p>
<p>The methods I use are annotations and drawings, and I personally prefer to write annotations. Although code is the best comment, I am willing to take the time to explain the background and meaning of the code with comments, and comments will make most people understand the meaning of the code faster. When I read Libuv, I also read some JS and C++ code interspersed.</p>
<p>The way I read Node.js source code is, pick a module and analyze it vertically from the JS layer to the C++ layer, then to the Libuv layer.</p>
<p>After reading Libuv, the next step is to read the code of the JS layer. Although JS is easy to understand, there is a lot of code in the JS layer, and I feel that the logic is very confusing, so so far, I still have not read it carefully. follow-up plans.</p>
<p>In Node.js, C++ is the glue layer. In many cases, C++ is not used, and it does not affect the reading of Node.js source code, because C++ is often only a function of transparent transmission. It sends the request of the JS layer through V8, passed to Libuv, and then in reverse, so I read the C++ layer at the end.</p>
<p>I think the C++ layer is the most difficult. At this time, I have to start reading the source code of V8 again. It is very difficult to understand V8. I chose almost the earliest version 0.1.5, and then combined with the 8.x version. Through the early version, first learn the general principles of V8 and some early implementation details. Because the subsequent versions have changed a lot, but more of them are enhancements and optimizations of functions, and many core concepts have not changed. Lost direction and lost momentum.</p>
<p>However, even in the early version, many contents are still very complicated. The reason for combining the new version is because some functions were not implemented in the previous version. To understand its principle at this time, you can only look at the code of the new version and have the experience of the early version, reading the new version of the code also has certain benefits, and also know some reading skills to some extent.</p>
<p>Most of the code in Node.js is in the C++ and JS layers, so I am still reading the code of these two layers constantly. Or according to the vertical analysis of modules. Reading Node.js code gave me a better understanding of the principles of Node.js and a better understanding of JS. However, the amount of code is very large and requires a steady stream of time and energy investment. But when it comes to technology, it’s a wonderful feeling to know what it is, and it’s not a good feeling that you make a living off a technology but don’t know much about it.</p>
<p>Although reading the source code will not bring you immediate and rapid benefits, there are several benefits that are inevitable. The first is that it will determine your height, and the second is that when you write the code, youInstead of seeing some cold, lifeless characters. This may be a bit exaggerated, but you understand the principles of technology, and when you use technology, you will indeed have different experiences, and your thinking will also have more changes.</p>
<p>The third is to improve your learning ability. When you have more understanding and understanding of the underlying principles, you will learn more quickly when you are learning other technologies. For example, if you understand the principle of epoll, then you can see When Nginx, Redis, Libuv and other source code are used, the event-driven logic can basically be understood very quickly.</p>
<p>I am very happy to have these experiences, and I have invested a lot of time and energy. I hope to have more understanding and understanding of Node.js in the future, and I hope to have more practice in the direction of Node.js.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-this-book"><a class="header" href="#the-purpose-of-this-book">The purpose of this book</a></h2>
<p>The original intention of reading the Node.js source code is to give yourself a deep understanding of the principles of Node.js, but I found that many students are also very interested in the principles of Node.js, because they have been writing about the principles of Node.js in their spare time.</p>
<p>Node.js source code analysis articles (based on Node.js V10 and V14), so I plan to organize these contents into a systematic book, so that interested students can systematically understand and understand the principles of Node.js. However, I hope that readers will not only learn the knowledge of Node.js from the book, but also learn how to read the source code of Node.js, and can complete the research of the source code independently. I also hope that more students will share their experiences. This book is not the whole of Node.js, but try to talk about it as much as possible.</p>
<p>The source code is very many, intricate, and there may be inaccuracies in understanding. Welcome to exchange. Because I have seen some implementations of early Linux kernels (0.11 and 1.2.13) and early V8 (0.1.5), the article will cite some of the codes in order to let readers know more about the general implementation principle of a knowledge point. If you are interested, you can read the relevant code by yourself.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-the-book"><a class="header" href="#the-structure-of-the-book">The structure of the book</a></h2>
<p>This book is divided into twenty-two chapters, and the code explained is based on the Linux system.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the composition and overall working principle of Node.js, and analyzes the process of starting Node.js. Finally, it introduces the evolution of the server architecture and the selected architecture of Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It mainly introduces the basic data structure and general logic in Node.js, which will be used in later chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the event loop of Libuv, which is the core of Node.js. This chapter specifically introduces the implementation of each stage in the event loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of thread pool in Libuv. Libuv thread pool is very important to Node.js. Many modules in Node.js need to use thread pool, including crypto, fs, dns, etc. Without a thread pool, the functionality of Node.js would be greatly reduced. At the same time, the communication mechanism between Libuv neutron thread and main thread is analyzed. It is also suitable for other child threads to communicate with the main thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of flow in Libuv. Flow is used in many places in Node.js source code, which can be said to be a very core concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze some important modules and general logic of C++ layer in Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the signal processing mechanism of Node.js. Signal is another way of inter-process communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of the dns module of Node.js, including the use and principle of cares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It mainly analyzes the implementation and use of the pipe module (Unix domain) in Node.js. The Unix domain is a way to realize inter-process communication, which solves the problem that processes without inheritance cannot communicate. And support for passing file descriptors greatly enhances the capabilities of Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of timer module in Node.js. A timer is a powerful tool for timing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of Node.js setImmediate and nextTick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the implementation of file modules in Node.js. File operations are functions that we often use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the implementation of the process module in Node.js. Multi-process enables Node.js to take advantage of multi-core capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the implementation of thread module in Node.js. Multi-process and multi-thread have similar functions but there are some differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the use and implementation principle of the cluster module in Node.js. The cluster module encapsulates the multi-process capability, making Node.j a server architecture that can use multi-process and utilize the multi-core capability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation and related content of UDP in Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly analyze the implementation of TCP module in Node.js. TCP is the core module of Node.js. Our commonly used HTTP and HTTPS are based on net module.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>It mainly introduces the implementation of JS layer Stream. The logic of the Stream module is very complicated, so I briefly explained it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly introduces the implementation of the event module in Node.js. Although the event module is simple, it is the core module of Node.js.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Readers This book is aimed at students who have some experience in using Node.js and are interested in the principles of Node.js, because this book analyzes the principles of Node.js from the perspective of Node.js source code, some of which are C, C++, so the reader needs to have a certain C and C++ foundation. In addition, it will be better to have a certain operating system, computer network, and V8 foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reading-suggestions"><a class="header" href="#reading-suggestions">Reading Suggestions</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended to read the first few basic and general contents, then read the implementation of a single module, and finally, if you are interested, read the chapter on how to expand Node.js. If you are already familiar with Node.js and are just interested in a certain module or content, you can go directly to a certain chapter. When I first started to read the Node.js source code, I chose the V10.x version. Later, Node.js has been updated to V14, so some of the codes in the book are V10 and V14. Libuv is V1.23. You can get it on my github.</p>
<h2 id="source-code-reading"><a class="header" href="#source-code-reading">Source code reading</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended that the source code of Node.js consists of JS, C++, and C.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Libuv is written in C language. In addition to understanding C syntax, understanding Libuv is more about the understanding of operating systems and networks. Some classic books can be referred to, such as &quot;Unix Network Programming&quot; 1 and 2 two volumes, &quot;Linux System Programming Manual&quot; upper and lower volumes, The Definitive Guide to TCP/IP, etc. There are also Linux API documentation and excellent articles on the Internet for reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++ mainly uses the capabilities provided by V8 to expand JS, and some functions are implemented in C++. In general, C++ is more of a glue layer, using V8 as a bridge to connect Libuv and JS. I don't know C++, and it doesn't completely affect the reading of the source code, but it will be better to know C++. To read the C++ layer code, in addition to the syntax, you also need to have a certain understanding and understanding of the concept and use of V8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JS code I believe that students who learn Node.js have no problem.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="11-introduction-to-nodejs"><a class="header" href="#11-introduction-to-nodejs">1.1 Introduction to Node.js</a></h2>
<p>Node.js is an event-driven single-process single-threaded application. Single threading is embodied in Node.js maintaining a series of tasks in a single thread, and then In the event loop, the nodes in the task queue are continuously consumed, and new tasks are continuously generated, which continuously drives the execution of Node.js in the generation and consumption of tasks. From another point of view, Node.js can be said to be multi-threaded, because the bottom layer of Node.js also maintains a thread pool, which is mainly used to process some tasks such as file IO, DNS, and CPU computing.</p>
<p>Node.js is mainly composed of V8, Libuv, and some other third-party modules (cares asynchronous DNS parsing library, HTTP parser, HTTP2 parser, compression library, encryption and decryption library, etc.). The Node.js source code is divided into three layers, namely JS, C++, and C.</p>
<p>Libuv is written in C language. The C++ layer mainly provides the JS layer with the ability to interact with the bottom layer through V8. The C++ layer also implements some functions. The JS layer It is user-oriented and provides users with an interface to call the underlying layer.</p>
<h3 id="111-js-engine-v8"><a class="header" href="#111-js-engine-v8">1.1.1 JS Engine V8</a></h3>
<p>Node.js is a JS runtime based on V8. It utilizes the capabilities provided by V8 and greatly expands the capabilities of JS. This extension does not add new language features to JS, but expands functional modules. For example, in the front end, we can use the Date function, but we cannot use the TCP function, because this function is not built-in in JS.</p>
<p>In Node.js, we can use TCP, which is what Node.js does, allowing users to use functions that do not exist in JS, such as files, networks. The core parts of Node.js are Libuv and V8. V8 is not only responsible for executing JS, but also supports custom extensions, realizing the ability of JS to call C++ and C++ to call JS.</p>
<p>For example, we can write a C++ module and call it in JS. Node.js makes use of this ability to expand the function. All C and C++ modules called by the JS layer are done through V8.</p>
<h3 id="112-libuv"><a class="header" href="#112-libuv">1.1.2 Libuv</a></h3>
<p>Libuv is the underlying asynchronous IO library of Node.js, but it provides functions not only IO, but also processes, threads, signals, timers, inter-process communication, etc., and Libuv smoothes the differences between various operating systems. The functions provided by Libuv are roughly as follows • Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets</li>
<li>Asynchronous DNS resolution</li>
<li>Asynchronous file and file system operations</li>
<li>File system events</li>
<li>ANSI escape code controlled TTY</li>
<li>IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or named pipes (Windows)</li>
<li>Child processes</li>
<li>Thread pool</li>
<li>Signal handling</li>
<li>High resolution clock</li>
<li>Threading and synchronization primitives</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of Libuv is a classic producer-consumer model. In the entire life cycle of Libuv, each round of the cycle will process the task queue maintained by each phase, and then execute the callbacks of the nodes in the task queue one by one. In the callback, new tasks are continuously produced, thereby continuously driving Libuv.</p>
<p><strong>The following is the overall execution process of Libuv</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210419231244173.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA,FF_size==,0_16,color" alt="" /></p>
<p>From the above figure, we roughly understand that Libuv is divided into several stages, and then continuously performs the tasks in each stage in a loop. Let's take a look at each stage in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Update the current time. At the beginning of each event loop, Libuv will update the current time to the variable. The remaining operations of this cycle can use this variable to obtain the current time to avoid excessive Too many system calls affect performance, the additional effect is that the timing is not so precise. But in a round of event loop, Libuv will actively update this time when necessary. For example, when returning after blocking the timeout time in epoll, it will update the current time variable again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the event loop is in the alive state, start processing each stage of the event loop, otherwise exit the event loop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What does alive state mean?</strong> If there are handles in the active and ref states, the request in the active state or the handle in the closing state, the event loop is considered to be alive (the details will be discussed later).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>timer stage: determine which node in the minimum heap has timed out, execute its callback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pending stage: execute pending callback. Generally speaking, all IO callbacks (network, file, DNS) will be executed in the Poll IO stage, but in some cases, the callback of the Poll IO stage will be delayed until the next loop execution, so this callback is executed in the pending stage For example, if there is an error in the IO callback or the writing of data is successful, the callback will be executed in the pending phase of the next event loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idle stage: The event loop will be executed every time (idle does not mean that the event loop will be executed when it is idle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prepare phase: similar to the idle phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poll IO stage: call the IO multiplexing interface provided by each platform (for example, epoll mode under Linux), wait for the timeout time at most, and execute the corresponding callback when returning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The calculation rule of timeout:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>timeout is 0 if the time loop is running in UV_RUN_NOWAIT mode.</li>
<li>If the time loop is about to exit (uv_stop was called), timeout is 0.</li>
<li>If there is no active handle or request, the timeout is 0.</li>
<li>If there are nodes in the queue with the idle phase, the timeout is 0.</li>
<li>If there is a handle waiting to be closed (that is, uv_close is adjusted), the timeout is 0.</li>
<li>If none of the above is satisfied, take the node with the fastest timeout in the timer phase as timeout.</li>
<li>If none of the above is satisfied, the timeout is equal to -1, that is, it will block until the condition is satisfied.</li>
<li>Check stage: same as idle and prepare. 9. Closing phase: Execute the callback passed in when calling the uv_close function. 10. If</li>
</ol>
<p>Libuv is running in <code>UV_RUN_ONCE</code> mode, the event loop is about to exit. But there is a situation that the timeout value of the Poll IO stage is the value of the node in the timer stage, and the Poll IO stage is returned because of the timeout, that is, no event occurs, and no IO callback is executed.</p>
<p>At this time, it needs to be executed once timer stage. Because a node timed out. 11. One round of event loop ends. If Libuv runs in UV_RUN_NOWAIT or <code>UV_RUN_ONCE</code> mode, it exits the event loop. If it runs in <code>UV_RUN_DEFAULT</code> mode and the status is alive, the next round of loop starts. Otherwise exit the event loop.</p>
<p>Below I can understand the basic principle of libuv through an example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    #include
    #include

    int64_t counter = 0;

    void wait_for_a_while(uv_idle_t* handle) {
        counter++;
        if (counter &amp;gt;= 10e6)
            uv_idle_stop(handle);
    }

    int main() {
        uv_idle_t idler;
         // Get the core structure of the event loop. and initialize an idle
        uv_idle_init(uv_default_loop(), &amp;amp;idler);
        // Insert a task into the idle phase of the event loop uv_idle_start(&amp;amp;idler, wait_for_a_while);
        // Start the event loop uv_run(uv_default_loop(), UV_RUN_DEFAULT);
        // Destroy libuv related data uv_loop_close(uv_default_loop());
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>To use Libuv, we first need to obtain <code>uv_loop_t</code>, the core structure of Libuv. <code>uv_loop_t</code> is a very large structure, which records the data of the entire life cycle of Libuv. uv_default_loop provides us with a <code>uv_loop_t</code> structure that has been initialized by default. Of course, we can also allocate one and initialize it ourselves.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    uv_loop_t* uv_default_loop(void) {
      // cache if (default_loop_ptr != NULL)
        return default_loop_ptr;

      if (uv_loop_init(&amp;amp;default_loop_struct))
        return NULL;

      default_loop_ptr = &amp;amp;default_loop_struct;
      return default_loop_ptr;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Libuv maintains a global <code>uv*loop_t structure</code>, which is initialized with <code>uv_loop_init</code>, and does not intend to explain the <code>uv_loop_init</code> function, because it probably initializes each field of the <code>uv_loop_t</code> structure. Then we look at the functions of the <code>uv_idle*</code> series.</p>
<p><strong>1 uv_idle_init</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int uv_idle_init(uv_loop_t* loop, uv_idle_t* handle) {
        /*
          Initialize the type of handle, belong to the loop, mark UV_HANDLE_REF,
          And insert handle into the end of the loop-&amp;gt;handle_queue queue */

        handle-&amp;gt;idle_cb = NULL;
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>After executing the uv_idle_init function, the memory view of Libuv is shown in the following figure</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210419232842899.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>2 uv_idle_start</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int uv_idle_start(uv_idle_t* handle, uv_idle_cb cb) {
      // If the start function has been executed, return directly if (uv__is_active(handle)) return 0;
       // Insert the handle into the idle queue in the loop QUEUE_INSERT_HEAD(&amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;loop-&amp;gt;idle_handles, &amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;queue);

       uv__handle_start(handle);
       return 0;
     }
</code></pre>
<p>The memory view after executing uv_idle_start is shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>Then execute uv_run to enter Libuv's event loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int uv_run(uv_loop_t* loop, uv_run_mode mode) {
      int timeout;
      int r;
      int ran_pending;
      // Submit the task to loop before uv_run
      r = uv__loop_alive(loop);
      // no tasks to process or uv_stop called
      while (r != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; loop-&amp;gt;stop_flag == 0) {
        // Process the idle queue uv__run_idle(loop);
      }

      // exited because uv_stop was called, reset the flag
      if (loop-&amp;gt;stop_flag != 0)
        loop-&amp;gt;stop_flag = 0;

<p>V8 provides a mechanism that allows us to call the functions provided by C++ and C language modules at the JS layer.

<h3 id="123-how-does-nodejs-achieve-expansion"><a class="header" href="#123-how-does-nodejs-achieve-expansion">1.2.3 How does Node.js achieve expansion?</a></h3>
<p>Node.js does not expand an object for each function, and then mounts it in a global variable, but expands a process object, and then expands the js function through process.binding. Node.js defines a global JS object process, which maps to a C++ object process, and maintains a linked list of C++ modules at the bottom layer. JS accesses the C++ process object by calling the process.binding of the JS layer, thereby accessing the C++ module ( Similar to accessing JS's Object, Date, etc.). However, Node.js version 14 has been changed to the internalBinding method, and the C++ module can be accessed through the internalBinding. The principle is similar.</p>
<h2 id="13-nodejs-startup-process"><a class="header" href="#13-nodejs-startup-process">1.3 Node.js startup process</a></h2>

<p>Let's go from top to bottom and look at what each process does.</p>
<h3 id="131-registering-c-modules"><a class="header" href="#131-registering-c-modules">1.3.1 Registering C++ modules</a></h3>
<p>The function of the RegisterBuiltinModules function (node_binding.cc) is to register C++ modules.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void RegisterBuiltinModules() {
    #define V(modname) _register_##modname();
      NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES(V)
    #undef V
    }
</code></pre>
<p>NODE_BUILTIN_MODULES is a C language macro, which is expanded as follows (omitting similar logic)</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void RegisterBuiltinModules() {
    #define V(modname) _register_##modname();
      V(tcp_wrap)
      V(timers)
      ...other modules #undef V
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Further expand as follows</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void RegisterBuiltinModules() {
 _register_tcp_wrap();
 _register_timers();
 }
</code></pre>
<p>A series of functions starting with <code>_register</code> are executed, but we cannot find these functions in the Node.js source code, because these functions are defined by macros in the file defined by each C++ module (the last line of the .cc file). Take the <code>tcp_wrap</code> module as an example to see how it does it. The last sentence of the code in the file <code>tcp_wrap</code>.cc NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT_AWARE_INTERNAL(<code>tcp_wrap</code>, node::TCPWrap::Initialize) macro expansion is</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#define NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT_AWARE_INTERNAL(modname, regfunc)
 NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT_AWARE_CPP(modname,
regfunc,
nullptr,
NM_F_INTERNAL)
</code></pre>
<p>Continue to expand</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#define NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT_AWARE_CPP(modname, regfunc, priv, flags
 static node::node_module _module = {
 NODE_MODULE_VERSION,

 NODE_STRINGIFY(modname),
 priv,
 nullptr};
 void _register_tcp_wrap() { node_module_register(&amp;amp;_module); }
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bottom layer of each C++ module defines a function starting with _register. When Node.js starts, these functions will be executed one by one. Let's continue to look at what these functions do, but before that, let's take a look at the data structures that represent C++ modules in Node.js.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    struct node_module {
      int nm_version;
      unsigned int nm_flags;
      void* nm_dso_handle;
      const char* nm_filename;
      node::addon_register_func nm_register_func;
      node::addon_context_register_func nm_context_register_func;
      const char* nm_modname;
      void* nm_priv;
      struct node_module* nm_link;
    };
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the function at the beginning of _register calls <code>node_module_register</code> and passes in a node_module data structure, so let's take a look at the implementation of node_module_register</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void node_module_register(void* m) {
struct node_module* mp = reinterpret_cast (m);
if (mp-&amp;gt;nm_flags &amp;amp; NM_F_INTERNAL) {
mp-&amp;gt;nm_link = modlist_internal;
modlist_internal = mp;
} else if (!node_is_initialized) {
mp-&amp;gt;nm_flags = NM_F_LINKED;
mp-&amp;gt;nm_link = modlist_linked;
modlist_linked = mp;
} else {
thread_local_modpending = mp;
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>We only look at AssignToContext and CreateProperties, set_env_vars will explain the process chapter.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 AssignToContext</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    inline void Environment::AssignToContext(v8::Local context,
                                             const ContextInfo&amp;amp; info) {
      // Save the env object in the context context-&amp;gt;SetAlignedPointerInEmbedderData(ContextEmbedderIndex::kEnvironment, this);

      context-&amp;gt;SetAlignedPointerInEmbedderData(ContextEmbedderIndex::kContextTag, Environment::kNodeContextTagPtr);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>AssignToContext is used to save the relationship between context and env. This logic is very important, because when the code is executed later, we will enter the field of V8. At this time, we only know Isolate and context. If we don't save the relationship between context and env, we don't know which env we currently belong to. Let's see how to get the corresponding env.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    inline Environment* Environment::GetCurrent(v8::Isolate* isolate) {

<p><strong>1.2 CreateProperties</strong></p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the logic of creating a process object in CreateProperties.</p>

<p>Mount the binding function in the process object (that is, the process object we usually use). This function is mainly used for built-in JS modules, which we will often see later. The logic of binding is to find the corresponding C++ module according to the module name. The above processing is for Node.js to load C++ modules through the binding function at the JS layer. We know that there are native JS modules (JS files in the lib folder) in Node.js. Next, let's take a look at the processing of loading native JS modules. Node.js defines a NativeModule class that is responsible for loading native JS modules. A variable is also defined to hold the list of names of native JS modules.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">static map = new Map(moduleIds.map((id) =&amp;gt; [id, new NativeModule(id)]));
</code></pre>
<p>The main logic of NativeModule is as follows: 1. The code of the native JS module is converted into characters and stored in the node_javascript.cc file. The NativeModule is responsible for the loading of the native JS module, that is, compilation and execution.
2 Provide a require function to load native JS modules. For modules whose file paths start with internal, they cannot be required by users.</p>
<p>This is the general logic of native JS module loading. Specifically, we will analyze it in the Node.js module loading chapter. After executing internal/bootstrap/loaders.js, finally return three variables to the C++ layer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">return {
  internalBinding,
  NativeModule,

<p>The C++ layer saves two of the functions, which are used to load the built-in C++ module and the function of the native JS module respectively.</p>

<p>Because Node.js adds support for threads, some properties need to be hacked. For example, when process.exit is used in a thread, a single thread is exited instead of the entire process, and functions such as exit need special handling. Later chapters will explain in detail.</p>

  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The environment variable NODE_CHANNEL_FD is set when the child process is created. If it is indicated that the currently started process is a child process, inter-process communication needs to be handled.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I will think deeply or look at its implementation. As we all know, when a server starts, it will listen to a port, which is actually a new socket. Then if a connection arrives, we can get the socket corresponding to the new connection through accept.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this socket and the listening socket the same? In fact, sockets are divided into listening type and communication type. On the surface, the server uses one port to realize multiple connections, but this port is used for monitoring, and the bottom layer is used for communication with the client is actually another socket. So every time a connection comes over, the socket responsible for monitoring finds that it is a packet (syn packet) that establishes a connection, and it will generate a new socket to communicate with (the one returned when accepting).</p>
<p>The listening socket only saves the IP and port it is listening on. The communication socket first copies the IP and port from the listening socket, and then records the client's IP and port. When a packet is received next time, the operating system will Find the socket from the socket pool according to the quadruple to complete the data processing.</p>
<p>The serial mode is to pick a node from the queue that has completed the three-way handshake, and then process it. Pick another node and process it again. If there is blocking IO in the process of processing, you can imagine how low the efficiency is. And when the amount of concurrency is relatively large, the queue corresponding to the listening socket will soon be full (the completed connection queue has a maximum length). This is the simplest mode, and although it is certainly not used in the design of the server, it gives us an idea of ​​the overall process of a server handling requests.</p>
<h3 id="142-multi-process-mode"><a class="header" href="#142-multi-process-mode">1.4.2 Multi-process mode</a></h3>
<p>In serial mode, all requests are queued and processed in one process, which is the reason for inefficiency. At this time, we can divide the request to multiple processes to improve efficiency, because in the serial processing mode, if there is a blocking IO operation, it will block the main process, thereby blocking the processing of subsequent requests. In the multi-process mode, if a request blocks a process, the operating system will suspend the process, and then schedule other processes to execute, so that other processes can perform new tasks. There are several types in multi-process mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The main process accepts, the child process processes the request</strong></p>
<p>In this mode, the main process is responsible for extracting the node that has completed the connection, and then handing over the request corresponding to this node to the child process for processing. The logic is as follows.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-js">    while(1) {
        const socketForCommunication = accept(socket);
        if (fork() &amp;gt; 0) {
             continue;
            // parent process } else {
            // child process handle(socketForCommunication);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>In this mode, every time a request comes, a new process will be created to handle it. This mode is slightly better than serial. Each request is processed independently. Assuming that a request is blocked in file IO, it will not affect the processing of b request, and it is as concurrent as possible. Its bottleneck is that the number of processes in the system is limited. If there are a large number of requests, the system cannot handle it. Furthermore, the overhead of the process is very large, which is a heavy burden for the system.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Process Pool Mode</strong>
Creating and destroying processes in real time is expensive and inefficient, so the process pool mode is derived. The process pool mode is to create a certain number of processes in advance when the server starts, but these processes are worker processes. It is not responsible for accepting requests. It is only responsible for processing requests. The main process is responsible for accept, and it hands the socket returned by accept to the worker process for processing, as shown in the figure below.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2021041923375310.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA==,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70" alt="" /></p>
<p>However, compared with the mode in 1, the process pool mode is relatively complicated, because in mode 1, when the main process receives a request, it will fork a child process in real time. At this time, the child process will inherit the new request in the main process. The corresponding fd, so it can directly process the request corresponding to the fd.</p>
<p>In the process pool mode, the child process is created in advance. When the main process receives a request, the child process cannot get the fd corresponding to the request. of. At this time, the main process needs to use the technique of passing file descriptors to pass the fd corresponding to this request to the child process. A process is actually a structure task_struct. In JS, we can say it is an object. It has a field that records the open file descriptor. When we access a file descriptor, the operating system will be based on the value of fd.</p>
<p>Find the underlying resource corresponding to fd from task_struct, so when the main process passes the file descriptor to the child process, it passes more than just a number fd, because if you only do this, the fd may not correspond to any resources in the child process, Or the corresponding resources are inconsistent with those in the main process. The operating system does a lot of things for us. Let us access the correct resource through fd in the child process, that is, the request received in the main process.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>child process accept</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This mode is not to wait until the request comes and then create the process. Instead, when the server starts, multiple processes are created. Then multiple processes call accept respectively. The architecture of this mode is shown in Figure 1-8.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210419233928634.png" alt="" /></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">    const socketfd = socket (configuration such as protocol type);
    bind(socketfd, listening address)

    for (let i = 0 ; i &amp;lt; number of processes; i++) {
        if (fork() &amp;gt; 0) {
            // The parent process is responsible for monitoring the child process} else {
            // The child process handles the request listen(socketfd);
            while(1) {
                const socketForCommunication = accept(socketfd);
                handle(socketForCommunication);
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>In this mode, multiple child processes are blocked in accept. If a request arrives at this time, all child processes will be woken up, but the child process that is scheduled first will take off the request node first. After the subsequent process is woken up, it may encounter that there is no request to process, and enter again. Sleep, the process is woken up ineffectively, which is the famous phenomenon of shocking herd. The improvement method is to add a lock before accept, and only the process that gets the lock can accept, which ensures that only one process will be blocked in accept. Nginx solves this problem, but the new version of the operating system has solved this problem at the kernel level. Only one process will be woken up at a time. Usually this pattern is used in conjunction with event-driven.</p>
<h3 id="143-multi-threading-mode"><a class="header" href="#143-multi-threading-mode">1.4.3 Multi-threading mode</a></h3>
<p>Multi-threading mode is similar to multi-process mode, and it is also divided into the following</p>
<p><strong>types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>main process accept</li>
<li>create sub-thread processing</li>
<li>sub-thread accept</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>The first two thread pools are the same as in the multi-process mode, but the third one is special, and we mainly introduce the third one. In the subprocess mode, each subprocess has its own task_struct, which means that after fork, each process is responsible for maintaining its own data, while the thread is different. The thread shares the data of the main thread (main process). , when the main process gets an fd from accept, if it is passed to the thread, the thread can operate directly. So in the thread pool mode, the architecture is shown in the following figure.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210419234043376.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA==,size_16,color_FFFFFF" alt="" /></p>
<p>The main process is responsible for accepting the request, and then inserting a task into the shared queue through mutual exclusion. The child threads in the thread pool also extract nodes from the shared queue for processing through mutual exclusion.</p>
<h3 id="144-event-driven"><a class="header" href="#144-event-driven">1.4.4 Event-driven</a></h3>
<p>Many servers (Nginx, Node.js, Redis) are now designed using the event-driven pattern. We know from previous design patterns that in order to handle a large number of requests, the server needs a large number of processes/threads. This is a very large overhead.</p>
<p>The event-driven mode is generally used with a single process (single thread). But because it is a single process, it is not suitable for CPU intensive, because if a task keeps occupying the CPU, subsequent tasks cannot be executed. It is more suitable for IO-intensive (generally provides a thread pool, responsible for processing CPU or blocking tasks). When using the multi-process/thread mode, a process/thread cannot occupy the CPU all the time.</p>
<p>After a certain period of time, the operating system will perform task scheduling. Let other threads also have the opportunity to execute, so that the previous tasks will not block the later tasks and starvation will occur. Most operating systems provide event-driven APIs. But event-driven is implemented differently in different systems. So there is usually a layer of abstraction to smooth out this difference. Here is an example of Linux epoll.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    // create an epoll

<p>Node.js belongs to the single-threaded event loop architecture. The event loop is implemented by the uv_run function of Libuv. The while loop is executed in this function, and then the event callbacks of each phase are continuously processed.</p>
<p>The processing of the event loop is equivalent to a consumer, consuming tasks generated by various codes. After Node.js is initialized, it begins to fall into the event loop, and the end of the event loop also means the end of Node.js. Let's take a look at the core code of the event loop.</p>

<p>Libuv is divided into several stages. The following is from first to last, and the relevant codes of each stage are analyzed separately.</p>
<h2 id="31-event-loop-timer-in-libuv"><a class="header" href="#31-event-loop-timer-in-libuv">3.1 Event loop timer In Libuv</a></h2>
<p>the timer stage is the first stage to be processed. The timer is implemented as a min heap, and the node that expires the fastest is the root node. Libuv caches the current time at the beginning of each event loop.</p>
<p>In each round of the event loop, the cached time is used. When necessary, Libuv will explicitly update this time, because the operation needs to be called to obtain the time. The interface provided by the system, and frequently calling the system call will bring a certain amount of time. The cache time can reduce the calls of the operating system and improve the performance.</p>
<p>After Libuv caches the current latest time, it executes uv__run_timers, which traverses the minimum heap and finds the current timeout node. Because the nature of the heap is that the parent node is definitely smaller than the child. And the root node is the smallest, so if a root node, it doesn't time out, the following nodes also don't time out. For the node that times out, its callback is executed. Let's look at the specific logic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void uv__run_timers(uv_loop_t* loop) {
      struct heap_node* heap_node;
      uv_timer_t* handle;
      // Traverse the binary heap for (;;) {
        // Find the smallest node heap_node = heap_min(timer_heap(loop));
        // if not exit if (heap_node == NULL)
          break;
        // Find the first address of the structure through the structure field handle = container_of(heap_node, uv_timer_t, heap_node);
        // The smallest node does not have a supermarket, and the subsequent nodes will not time out if (handle-&amp;gt;timeout &amp;gt; loop-&amp;gt;time)
          break;
        // delete the node uv_timer_stop(handle);
        /*
          Retry inserting into the binary heap, if necessary (repeat is set, such as setInterval)
        */
        uv_timer_again(handle);
        // Execute callback handle-&amp;gt;timer_cb(handle);
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>After executing the callback, there are two key operations, the first is stop, and the second is again. The logic of stop is very simple, that is, delete the handle from the binary heap and modify the state of the handle.</p>
<p>So what is again? again is to support the scenario of setInterval. If the handle is set with the repeat flag, the handle will continue to execute the timeout callback after every repeat time after the handle times out. For setInterval, the timeout is x, and the callback is executed after every x time.</p>
<p>This is the underlying principle of timers in Node.js. But Node.js does not insert a node into the min heap every time setTimeout/setInterval is adjusted. In Node.js, there is only one handle about uv_timer_s, which maintains a data structure in the JS layer, and calculates the earliest expiration every time. node, and then modify the timeout time of the handle, which is explained in the timer chapter.</p>
<p>In addition, the timer stage is also related to the Poll IO stage, because Poll IO may cause the main thread to block. In order to ensure that the main thread can execute the timer callback as soon as possible, Poll IO cannot block all the time, so at this time, the blocking time is the fastest The duration of the timer node of the period (for details, please refer to the uv_backend_timeout function in libuv core.c).</p>
<h2 id="32-pending-stage"><a class="header" href="#32-pending-stage">3.2 pending stage</a></h2>
<p>The official website's explanation of the pending stage is that the IO callbacks that were not executed in the Poll IO stage of the previous round will be executed in the pending stage of the next round of loops.</p>
<p>From the source code point of view, when processing tasks in the Poll IO stage, in some cases, if the currently executed operation fails, a callback function needs to be executed to notify the caller of some information.</p>
<p>The callback function will not be executed immediately, but will be pending in the next round of the event loop. Stage execution (such as successful writing of data, or callback to the C++ layer when the TCP connection fails), let's first look at the processing of the pending stage.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    static int uv__run_pending(uv_loop_t* loop) {
      QUEUE* q;
      QUEUE pq;
      uv__io_t* w;

      if (QUEUE_EMPTY(&amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;pending_queue))
        return 0;
      // Move the node of the pending_queue queue to pq, that is, clear the pending_queue
      QUEUE_MOVE(&amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;pending_queue, &amp;amp;pq);

      // Traverse the pq queue while (!QUEUE_EMPTY(&amp;amp;pq)) {
        // Take out the current first node to be processed, ie pq.next
        q = QUEUE_HEAD(&amp;amp;pq);
        // Remove the current node to be processed from the queue QUEUE_REMOVE(q);
        /*
          Reset the prev and next pointers, because at this time these two pointers point to the two nodes in the queue */
        QUEUE_INIT(q);
        w = QUEUE_DATA(q, uv__io_t, pending_queue);
        w-&amp;gt;cb(loop, w, POLLOUT);
      }

      return 1;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The processing logic of the pending phase is to execute the nodes in the pending queue one by one. Let's take a look at how the nodes of the pending queue are produced.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void uv__io_feed(uv_loop_t* loop, uv__io_t* w) {
      if (QUEUE_EMPTY(&amp;amp;w-&amp;gt;pending_queue))
        QUEUE_INSERT_TAIL(&amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;pending_queue, &amp;amp;w-&amp;gt;pending_queue);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Libuv generates pending tasks through the uv<strong>io_feed function. From the Libuv code, we will call this function when we see IO errors (such as the uv</strong>tcp_connect function of tcp.c).</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    if (handle-&amp;gt;delayed_error)
        uv__io_feed(handle-&amp;gt;loop, &amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;io_watcher);
</code></pre>
<p>After the data is written successfully (such as TCP, UDP), a node is also inserted into the pending queue, waiting for a callback. For example, the code executed after sending data successfully (uv__udp_sendmsg function of udp.c)</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    // Move out of the write queue after sending QUEUE_REMOVE(&amp;amp;req-&amp;gt;queue);
    // Join the write completion queue QUEUE_INSERT_TAIL(&amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;write_completed_queue, &amp;amp;req-&amp;gt;queue);
    /*
      After some node data is written, insert the IO observer into the pending queue,
      Execute callback in pending stage */
    uv__io_feed(handle-&amp;gt;loop, &amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;io_watcher);
</code></pre>
<p>When the IO is finally closed (such as closing a TCP connection), the corresponding node will be removed from the pending queue. Because it has been closed, naturally there is no need to execute the callback.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void uv__io_close(uv_loop_t* loop, uv__io_t* w) {
      uv__io_stop(loop,
                    w,
                    POLLIN | POLLOUT | UV__POLLRDHUP | UV__POLLPRI);
      QUEUE_REMOVE(&amp;amp;w-&amp;gt;pending_queue);
    }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="33-prepare-check-idle-of-event-loop"><a class="header" href="#33-prepare-check-idle-of-event-loop">3.3 prepare, check, idle of event loop</a></h2>
<p>prepare, check, and idle are relatively simple stages in the Libuv event loop, and their implementations are the same (see loop-watcher.c). This section only explains the prepare stage. We know that Libuv is divided into handle and request, and the tasks of the prepare stage belong to the handle type. This means that nodes in the prepare phase are executed every time the event loop occurs unless we explicitly remove them. Let's first see how to use it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void prep_cb(uv_prepare_t *handle) {
        printf(&quot;Prep callback\n&quot;);
    }

    int main() {
        uv_prepare_t prep;
        // Initialize a handle, uv_default_loop is the core structure of the event loop uv_prepare_init(uv_default_loop(), &amp;amp;prep);
            // Register handle callback uv_prepare_start(&amp;amp;prep, prep_cb);
            // Start the event loop uv_run(uv_default_loop(), UV_RUN_DEFAULT);
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>When the main function is executed, Libuv will execute the callback prep_cb in the prepare phase. Let's analyze this process.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int uv_prepare_init(uv_loop_t* loop, uv_prepare_t* handle) {
        uv__handle_init(loop, (uv_handle_t*)handle, UV_PREPARE);
        handle-&amp;gt;prepare_cb = NULL;
        returnThe node is removed from the current queue QUEUE_REMOVE(q);
           // Reinsert the original queue QUEUE_INSERT_TAIL(&amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;prepare_handles, q);
           // Execute the callback function h-&amp;gt;prepare_cb(h);
        }
      }
</code></pre>
<p>The logic of the uv__run_prepare function is very simple, but one key point is that after each node is executed, Libuv will re-insert the node into the queue, so the nodes in the prepare (including idle, check) stage will be executed in each round of the event loop. implement. Nodes such as timer, pending, and closing stages are one-time and will be removed from the queue after being executed.
Let's review the test code at the beginning.</p>
<p>Because it sets the operating mode of Libuv to be the default mode. The prepare queue always has a handle node, so it will not exit. It will always execute the callback. So what if we want to quit? Or do not execute a node of the prepare queue. We just need to stop it once.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">       int uv_prepare_stop(uv_prepare_t* handle) {
        if (!uv__is_active(handle)) return 0;
        // Remove the handle from the prepare queue, but also mount it in handle_queue QUEUE_REMOVE(&amp;amp;handle-&amp;gt;queue);
         // Clear the active flag bit and subtract the active number of handles in the loop uv__handle_stop(handle);
        return 0;
      }
</code></pre>
<p>The stop function and the start function have opposite functions, which is the principle of the prepare, check, and idle phases in Node.js.</p>
<h2 id="34-poll-io-of-event-loop"><a class="header" href="#34-poll-io-of-event-loop">3.4 Poll IO of event loop</a></h2>
<p>Poll IO is a very important stage of Libuv. File IO, network IO, signal processing, etc. are all processed in this stage, which is also the most complicated stage. The processing logic is in the uv**io_poll function of core.c. This function is more complicated, so we analyze it separately. Before starting to analyze Poll IO, let's take a look at some of the data structures related to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>IO observer uv**io_t. This structure is the core structure of the Poll IO stage. It mainly saves IO-related file descriptors, callbacks, events of interest and other information.</li>
<li>watcher_queue watcher queue. All IO observers that need to be processed by Libuv are mounted in this queue, and Libuv will be processed one by one in the Poll IO stage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next we start to analyze the Poll IO stage. Look at the first paragraph of logic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">     // If there is no IO observer, return directly if (loop-&amp;gt;nfds == 0) {

<p><code>epoll_wait</code> may cause the main thread to block, so the current time needs to be updated after wait returns, otherwise the time difference will be relatively large when used, because Libuv will cache the current time value at the beginning of each round of time loop. Use it directly in other places, instead of getting it every time. Next, let's look at the processing after epoll returns (assuming an event is triggered).</p>

<p>It is then processed one by one in the close phase. Let's take a look at the processing logic of the close phase</p>

       if (handle-&amp;gt;close_cb) {
         handle-&amp;gt;close_cb(handle);
       }
     }

</code></pre>
<p>uv__run_closing_handles will execute the callback of each task node one by one.</p>
<h2 id="36-controlling-the-event-loop"><a class="header" href="#36-controlling-the-event-loop">3.6 Controlling the event loop</a></h2>
<p>Libuv uses the uv__loop_alive function to determine whether the event loop needs to continue to execute. Let's look at the definition of this function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    static int uv__loop_alive(const uv_loop_t* loop) {
      return uv__has_active_handles(loop) ||
             uv__has_active_reqs(loop) ||
             loop-&amp;gt;closing_handles != NULL;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Why is there a judgment of closing_handle? Judging from the code of uv_run, after the close phase is executed, uv_loop_alive will be executed immediately. Normally, the queue in the close phase is empty, but if we add a new node to the close queue in the close callback, and the node It will not be executed in the close phase of this round, which will cause the close phase to be executed, but there are still nodes in the close queue. If it exits directly, the corresponding callback cannot be executed.
We see three cases where Libuv considers the event loop to be alive. If we control these three conditions, we can control the exit of the event loop. Let us understand this process with an example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">    const timeout = setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
      console.log('never console')
    }, 5000);
    timeout.unref();
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, the callback of setTimeout will not be executed. Unless the timeout period is very short, it will expire when the first round of event loop is short, otherwise after the first round of event loop, due to the influence of unref, the event loop exits directly. Unref affects the handle condition. The event loop code is as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    while (r != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; loop-&amp;gt;stop_flag == 0) {
        uv__update_time(loop);
        uv__run_timers(loop);
        // ...
        // uv__loop_alive returns false and jumps out of the while, thereby exiting the event loop r = uv__loop_alive(loop);
    }

<p>Libuv is a single-threaded event-driven asynchronous IO library. For blocking or time-consuming operations, if executed in the main loop of Libuv, it will block the execution of subsequent tasks,</p>
<p>so Libuv maintains a Thread pool, which is responsible for processing time-consuming or blocking operations in Libuv, such as file IO, DNS, and custom time-consuming tasks. The location of the thread pool in the Libuv architecture is shown in Figure 4-1.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210420234827155.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA==,size_16,color_FFFFFF" alt="" /></p>
<p>The main thread of Libuv submits the task to the thread pool through the interface provided by the thread pool, and then immediately returns to the event loop to continue execution. The thread pool maintains a task queue, and multiple sub-threads will pick off the task node from it for execution. After the thread has completed the task, it will notify the main thread, and the main thread will execute the corresponding callback in the Poll IO stage of the event loop. Let's take a look at the implementation of the thread pool in Libuv.</p>
<h2 id="41-communication-between-main-thread-and-sub-thread"><a class="header" href="#41-communication-between-main-thread-and-sub-thread">4.1 Communication between main thread and sub-thread</a></h2>
<p>The communication between Libuv sub-thread and main thread is implemented using the uv_async_t structure.</p>
<p>Libuv uses the loop-&gt;async_handles queue to record all uv_async_t structures, and uses loop-&gt;async_io_watcher as the IO watcher of all uv_async_t structures, that is, all handles on the loop-&gt;async_handles queue share the async_io_watcher IO watcher.</p>
<p>When inserting a uv_async_t structure into the async_handle queue for the first time, the IO observer will be initialized. If an async_handle is registered again, only one node will be inserted into the loop-&gt;async_handle queue and handle queue, and an IO observer will not be added. When the task corresponding to the uv_async_t structure is completed, the child thread will set the IO observer to be readable.</p>
<p>Libuv handles IO observers during the Poll IO phase of the event loop. Let's take a look at the use of uv_async_t in Libuv.</p>

<p>The uv_async_init function mainly initializes some fields of the structure uv_async_t, and then executes QUEUE_INSERT_TAIL to add a node to Libuv's async_handles queue. We see that there is also a uv *async_start function. Let's look at the implementation of uv *async_start.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    static int uv__async_start(uv_loop_t* loop) {

        // If eventfd is not supported, use anonymous pipe err = uv__make_pipe(pipefd, UV__F_NONBLOCK);
    #if defined(__Linux__)
        if (err == 0) {
          char buf[32];
          int fd;
          snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), &quot;/proc/self/fd/%d&quot;, pipefd[0]); // Reading and writing to pipes can be achieved through a fd, advanced usage fd = uv__open_cloexec(buf, O_RDWR );
          if (fd &amp;gt;= 0) {
            // close the old uv__close(pipefd[0]);
            uv__close(pipefd[1]);// assign new pipefd[0] = fd;
            pipefd[1] = fd;
          }
        }
    #endif
      }
      // err greater than or equal to 0 means that the read and write ends of the communication are obtained if (err &amp;lt; 0)
        return err;
      /*
          Initialize IO watcher async_io_watcher,
          Save the read file descriptor to the IO observer */
      uv__io_init(&amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;async_io_watcher, uv__async_io, pipefd[0]);
      // Register the IO watcher in the loop, and register the interested event POLLIN, waiting for the read uv__io_start(loop, &amp;amp;loop-&amp;gt;async_io_watcher, POLLIN);
        // Save the write file descriptor loop-&amp;gt;async_wfd = pipefd[1];
      return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>uv_async_start will only be executed once, and the timing is when uv_async_init is executed for the first time. The main logic of uv**async_start is as follows: 1 Obtain the communication descriptor (generate a communication fd through eventfd (acting as both read and write ends) or the pipeline generates two fds for inter-thread communication representing the read end and the write end).
2 Encapsulate interesting events and callbacks to IO observers and then append them to the watcher_queue queue. In the Poll IO stage, Libuv will be registered in epoll.</p>
<p>If there are tasks completed, the callback will also be executed in the Poll IO stage.
3 Save the write side descriptor. When the task is completed, the main thread is notified through the write-side fd.
We see that there is a lot of logic in the uv**async_start function to obtain the communication file descriptor. In general, it is to complete the function of communication between the two ends. After initializing the async structure, the Libuv structure is shown in Figure 4-2.</p>

<p>uv_async_send first gets the fd corresponding to the write end, and then calls the write function. At this time, data is written to the write end of the pipeline, and the task is marked as complete. Where there is writing, there must be reading. The logic for reading is implemented in uv *io_poll. The uv *io_poll function is the function executed in the Poll IO stage in Libuv. In uv *io_poll, the pipeline will be found to be readable, and then the corresponding callback uv *async_io will be executed.</p>

<p>This is the producer logic of the thread pool in Libuv. The architecture of the task queue is shown in Figure 4-3.</p>

<p>In addition to the above mentioned, Libuv also provides another way to produce tasks, the uv_queue_work function, which only submits CPU-intensive tasks (used in Node.js's crypto module). Let's look at the implementation of uv_queue_work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int uv_queue_work(uv_loop_t* loop,
                      uv_work_t* req,
                      uv_work_cb work_cb,
                      uv_after_work_cb after_work_cb) {
      if (work_cb == NULL)
        return UV_EINVAL;

      uv__req_init(loop, req, UV_WORK);
      req-&amp;gt;loop = loop;
      req-&amp;gt;work_cb = work_cb;
      req-&amp;gt;after_work_cb = after_work_cb;
      uv__work_submit(loop,
              &amp;amp;req-&amp;gt;work_req,
              UV__WORK_CPU,
              uv__queue_work,
              uv__queue_done);
      return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The uv_queue_work function actually doesn't have much logic. It saves the user's work function and calls it back into the request. Then encapsulate uv *queue_work and uv *queue_done into uv**work, and then submit tasks to the thread pool. So when this task is executed. It will execute the work function uv *queue_work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    static void uv__queue_work(struct uv__work* w) {
      // Get the structure address through a field of the structure uv_work_t* req = container_of(w, uv_work_t, work_req);
      req-&amp;gt;work_cb(req);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>We see that uv *queue_work actually encapsulates user-defined task functions. At this time, we can guess that uv *queue_done is just a simple encapsulation of the user's callback, that is, it will execute the user's callback.</p>

<p>We see that the logic of consumers seems to be more complicated. For tasks of slow IO type, Libuv limits the number of threads that process slow IO tasks, so as to avoid tasks that take less time from being processed. The rest of the logic is similar to the general thread pool, that is, mutual exclusive access to the task queue, then take out the node for execution, and notify the main thread after execution. The structure is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>

<p>We have just analyzed the communication mechanism between the main thread and the sub-thread. wq_async is the async handle used for the communication between the sub-thread and the main thread in the thread pool, and its corresponding callback is uv<strong>work_done. So when the thread task of a thread pool is completed, set loop-&gt;wq_async.pending = 1 through uv_async_send(&amp;w-&gt;loop-&gt;wq_async), and then notify the IO observer, Libuv will execute the corresponding handle in the Poll IO stage Call back the uv</strong>work_done function. So let's look at the logic of this function.</p>

    }
</code></pre>
<p>The logic of this function is relatively simple. It processes the completed task nodes one by one and executes the callback. In Node.js, the callback here is the C++ layer, and then to the JS layer. The structure diagram is shown in Figure 4-5.</p>

<p>In the implementation of the stream, the core field is the IO observer, and the rest of the fields are related to the nature of the stream. The IO observer encapsulates the file descriptor corresponding to the stream and the callback when the file descriptor event is triggered. For example, read a stream, write a stream, close a stream, connect a stream, listen to a stream, there are corresponding fields in uv_stream_s to support. But it is essentially driven by IO observers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To read a stream, that is, when the readable event of the file descriptor in the IO observer is triggered, the user's read callback is executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a stream, first write the data to the stream, wait until the file descriptor writable event in the IO observer is triggered, execute the real write, and execute the user's write end callback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To close a stream, that is, when the file descriptor writable event in the IO observer is triggered, the write end of the closed stream will be executed. If there is still data in the stream that has not been written, it will be written (such as sending) before the close operation is performed, and then the user's callback will be executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connection streams, such as connecting to a server as a client. That is, when the file descriptor readable event in the IO observer is triggered (for example, the establishment of the three-way handshake is successful), the user's callback is executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to the stream, that is, when the file descriptor readable event in the IO observer is triggered (for example, there is a connection that completes the three-way handshake), the user's callback is executed.</p>

<p>If the parent process or the child process creates a new file descriptor after fork, the parent and child processes cannot share it. Suppose the parent process wants to pass a file descriptor to the child process, what should we do? According to the relationship between process and file descriptor.</p>

<p>There are many logical branches of the maybe_new_socket function, mainly as follows 1 If the stream has not been associated with fd, apply for a new fd to be associated with the stream 2 If the stream has been associated with an fd.</p>
<p>If the stream is marked with a binding address, but an address has been bound by Libuv (Libuv will set the UV_HANDLE_BOUND flag, the user may also directly call the bind function to bind). You do not need to bind again, just update the flags.</p>
<p>If the stream is marked with a binding address, but an address has not been bound through Libuv, at this time, getsocketname is used to determine whether the user has bound an address through the bind function.

<p>The logic of the connection flow is roughly as follows: 1 Apply for a socket and bind an address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the given server address, initiate a three-way handshake, non-blocking, it will return directly to continue execution, and will not wait until the three-way handshake is completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mount a connect request to the stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the events of interest to the IO observer as writable. Then insert the IO observer into the IO observer queue of the event loop. When waiting for writability (complete the three-way handshake), the cb callback will be executed.</p>

<h2 id="65-how-js-uses-c"><a class="header" href="#65-how-js-uses-c">6.5 How JS uses C++</a></h2>
<p>The ability of JS to call C++ modules is provided by V8, and Node.js uses this ability. In this way, we only need to face JS, and leave the rest to Node.js. This article first talks about how to use V8 to implement JS to call C++, and then talk about how Node.js does it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>JS calls C++</strong>
First, let's introduce two very core classes in V8, FunctionTemplate and ObjectTemplate. As the names suggest, these two classes define templates, just like the design drawings when building a house. Through the design drawings, we can build the corresponding house. V8 is also, if you define a template, you can create a corresponding instance through this template. These concepts are described below (for convenience, the following is pseudocode).</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1 <strong>Define a function template</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">Local functionTemplate = v8::FunctionTemplate::New(isolate(), New);
// Define the name of the function functionTemplate-&amp;gt;SetClassName('TCP')

</code></pre>
<p>First define a <code>FunctionTemplate</code> object. We see that the second parameter of FunctionTemplate is a function, and when we execute the function created by FunctionTemplate, v8 will execute the New function. Of course we can also not pass it on.</p>
<p>1.2 Define the prototype content of the function template The prototype is the function.prototype in JS.</p>
<p>If you understand the knowledge in JS, it is easy to understand the code in C++.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    v8::Local t = v8::FunctionTemplate::New(isolate(), callback);
    t-&amp;gt;SetClassName('test');
    // Define a property on prototype t-&amp;gt;PrototypeTemplate()-&amp;gt;Set('hello', 'world');
</code></pre>
<p>1.3 Define the content of the instance template corresponding to the function template An instance template is an ObjectTemplate object. It defines the properties of the return value when the function created by the function template is executed as new.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function A() {
  this.a = 1;
  this.b = 2;
}
new A();
</code></pre>
<p>The instance template is similar to the code in the A function in the above code. Let's see how it is defined in V8.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    t-&amp;gt;InstanceTemplate()-&amp;gt;Set(key, val);
    t-&amp;gt;InstanceTemplate()-&amp;gt;SetInternalFieldCount(1);
</code></pre>
<p>InstanceTemplate returns an ObjectTemplate object. The SetInternalFieldCount function is special and important. We know that an object is a piece of memory, and an object has its own memory layout. We know that in C++, when we define a class, we define the layout of the object. For example, we have the following definition.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    class demo
    {
     private:
      intconst int kConstructorOffset = TemplateInfo::kHeaderSize;
      static const int kInternalFieldCountOffset = kConstructorOffset + kPointerSize;
      static const int kSize = kInternalFieldCountOffset + kHeaderSize;
    };
</code></pre>
<p>The memory layout is shown in Figure 6-5.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/9cfde2c74ac24d529350ffda1bc6c2ac.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA,FF_FFt==,0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Coming back to the question of object templates, let's see what Set(key, val) does.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void Template::Set(v8::Handle name, v8::Handle value, v8::PropertyAttribute attribute) {
      // ... i::Handle list(Utils::OpenHandle(this)-&amp;gt;property_list());
     NeanderArray array(list);
     array.add(Utils::OpenHandle(*name));
     array.add(Utils::OpenHandle(*value));
     array.add(Utils::OpenHandle(*v8::Integer::New(attribute)));
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is roughly to append some content to a list. Let's see how this list comes from, that is, the implementation of the property_list function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">// Read the value of a property in the object
  #define READ_FIELD(p, offset) (*reinterpret_cast (FIELD_ADDR(p, offset))
  static Object* cast(Object* value) { return value; }
  Object* TemplateInfo::property_list() { return Object::cast(READ_FIELD(this, kPropertyListOffset)); }
</code></pre>
<p>From the above code, we know that the internal layout is shown in Figure 6-6.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/10abb0324ce54c9eba3743e8f4e61cc2.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6FFLy9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA==,size" alt="" />
Figure 6-6</p>
<p>According to the memory layout, we know that the value of property_list is the value pointed to by list. Therefore, the memory operated by Set(key, val) is not the memory of the object itself. The object uses a pointer to point to a piece of memory to store the value of Set(key, val). The SetInternalFieldCount function is different, it affects (expands) the memory of the object itself. Let's take a look at its implementation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void ObjectTemplate::SetInternalFieldCount(int value) {
  // The modification is the value of the memory corresponding to kInternalFieldCountOffset
  Utils::OpenHandle(this)-&amp;gt;set_internal_field_count(i::Smi::FromInt(value)); }

</code></pre>
<p>We see that the implementation of the SetInternalFieldCount function is very simple, which is to save a number in the memory of the object itself. Next we look at the use of this field. Its usefulness will be described in detail later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
handle Factory::CreateApiFunction( handle obj, bool is_global) { int internal_field_count = 0; if (!obj-&amp;gt;instance_template()-&amp;gt;IsUndefined()) {
   // Get the instance template Handle of the function template
   instance_template = Handle (ObjectTemplateInfo::cast(obj-&amp;gt;instance_template()));
    // Get the value of the internal_field_count field of the instance template (the one set by SetInternalFieldCount)
    internal_field_count = Smi::cast(instance_template-&amp;gt;internal_field_count())-&amp;gt;value(); }
    // Calculate the space required for the new object, if int instance_size = kPointerSize
    * internal_field_count; if (is_global) { instance_size += JSGlobalObject::kSize; } else { instance_size += JSObject::kHeaderSize; }
    InstanceType type = is_global ? JS_GLOBAL_OBJECT_TYPE : JS_OBJECT_TYPE;

     // Create a new function object Handle
     result = Factory::NewFunction(Factory::empty_symbol(), type, instance_size, code, true); }

</code></pre>
<p>We see that the meaning of the value of internal_field_count is to expand the memory of the object.</p>
<p>For example, an object itself has only n bytes. If the value of internal_field_count is defined as 1, the memory of the object will become n+internal_field_count * The number of bytes of a pointer .</p>
<p>The memory layout is shown in Figure 6-7. <img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/e3ac46175f034690a3cda19d2e61969d.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG09nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJLSA==,size_1RIRUFOQVJLSA==" alt="" />

<p>1.4 Create a function Local through a function template functionTemplate = v8::FunctionTemplate::New(isolate(), New); global-&gt;Set('demo', functionTemplate -&gt;GetFunction()); In this way, we can directly call the demo variable in JS, and then the corresponding function will be executed. This is how JS calls C++.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How Node.js handles the problem of JS calling C++ Let's take the TCP module as an example.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">TCPWrap(env, args.This(), provider);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">const { TCP } = process.binding('tcp_wrap'); new TCP(...);
</code></pre>
<p>We follow the inheritance relationship of TCPWrap, all the way to HandleWrap</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    HandleWrap::HandleWrap(Environment* env,
                           Local object,
                           uv_handle_t* handle,
                           AsyncWrap::ProviderType provider)
        : AsyncWrap(env, object, provider),
          state_(kInitialized),
          handle_(handle) {
      // Save the relationship between Libuv handle and C++ object handle_-&amp;gt;data = this;
      HandleScope scope(env-&amp;gt;isolate());
      // Insert handle queue env-&amp;gt;handle_wrap_queue()-&amp;gt;PushBack(this);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>HandleWrap first saves the relationship between the Libuv structure and the C++ object. Then we continue to analyze along AsyncWrap, AsyncWrap inherits BaseObject, we look directly at BaseObject.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    // Store the object in persistent_handle_, and take it out through object() if necessary BaseObject::BaseObject(Environment* env, v8::Local object)
        : persistent_handle_(env-&amp;gt;isolate(), object), env_(env) {
      // Store this in object object-&amp;gt;SetAlignedPointerInInternalField(0, static_cast (this));
      env-&amp;gt;AddCleanupHook(DeleteMe, static_cast (this));
      env-&amp;gt;modify_base_object_count(1);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>We look at SetAlignedPointerInInternalField.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    void v8::Object::SetAlignedPointerInInternalField(int index, void* value) {
      i::Handle obj = Utils::OpenHandle(this);
      i::Handle ::cast(obj)-&amp;gt;SetEmbedderField(
          index, EncodeAlignedAsSmi(value, location));
    }

    void JSObject::SetEmbedderField(int index, Smi* value) {
      // GetHeaderSize is the size of the fixed layout of the object, kPointerSize * index is the expanded memory size, find the corresponding position according to the index
      int offset = GetHeaderSize() + (kPointerSize * index);
      // Write the memory of the corresponding location, that is, save the corresponding content to the memory
      WRITE_FIELD(this, offset, value);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>After the SetAlignedPointerInInternalField function is expanded, what it does is to save a value into the memory of the V8 C++ object. What is the stored value? The input parameter object of BaseObject is the object created by the function template, and this is a TCPWrap object. So what the SetAlignedPointerInInternalField function does is to save a TCPWrap object to an object created by a function template, as shown in Figure 6-8.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/cead0241ca5a4f02b38727ae85145fcc.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L1RIRUFOQVJFFt_7,size_0" alt="" />
Figure 6-8</p>
<p>What's the use of this? We continue to analyze. At this time, the new TCP is executed. Let's look at the logic of executing the tcp.connect() function at this time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    // template
    void TCPWrap::Connect(const FunctionCallbackInfo &amp;amp; args,
        std::function uv_ip_addr) {
      Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);

      TCPWrap* wrap;
      ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP(&amp;amp;wrap,
                              args.Holder(),
                              args.GetReturnValue().Set(UV_EBADF));
      // Omit some irrelevant code args.GetReturnValue().Set(err);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>We just have to look at the logic of the ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP macro. Among them, args.Holder() represents the owner of the Connect function. According to the previous analysis, we know that the owner is the object created by the function template defined by the Initialize function. This object holds a TCPWrap object. The main logic of ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP is to take out the TCPWrap object saved in the C++ object. Then you can use the handle of the TCPWrap object to request Libuv.</p>
<h2 id="67-c-layer-calls-libuv"><a class="header" href="#67-c-layer-calls-libuv">6.7 C++ layer calls Libuv</a></h2>
<p>Just now we analyzed how the JS calls the C++ layer and how they are linked together, and then we look at how the C++ calls Libuv and the Libuv callback C++ layer is linked together. We continue to analyze the process through the connect function of the TCP module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    template
    void TCPWrap::Connect(const FunctionCallbackInfo &amp;amp; args,
        std::function uv_ip_addr) {
      Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);

      ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP(&amp;amp;wrap,

                              args.GetReturnValue().Set(UV_EBADF));

      // The first parameter is the TCPConnectWrap object, see the net module Local req_wrap_obj = args[0].As ();
      // The second is the ip address node::Utf8Value ip_address(env-&amp;gt;isolate(), args[1]);

      T addr;
      // Set the port and IP to addr, the port information is in the context of uv_ip_addr int err = uv_ip_addr(*ip_address, &amp;amp;addr);

      if (err == 0) {
        ConnectWrap* req_wrap =
            new ConnectWrap(env,
                              req_wrap_obj,
            )
</code></pre>
<p>that is because a large number of template parameters are used. CallLibuvFunction is essentially a struct, which is similar to a class in C++. There is only one class function Call. In order to adapt to the calls of various types of functions in the Libuv layer, Node.js implements Three types of CallLibuvFunction are used, and a large number of template parameters are used. We only need to analyze one. We start the analysis based on the connect function of TCP. We first specify the template parameters of the Dispatch function.</p>
<p>T corresponds to the type of ReqWrap, and LibuvFunction corresponds to the function type of Libuv. Here is int uv_tcp_connect(uv_connect_t* req, ...), so it corresponds to the second case of LibuvFunction. Args is the first argument when executing Dispatch. remaining parameters. Below we concrete Dispatch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int ReqWrap ::Dispatch(int(*)(uv_connect_t*, Args...), Args... args) {
      req_.data = this;
      int err = CallLibuvFunction ::Call(

          env()-&amp;gt;event_loop(),
          req(),
          MakeLibuvRequestCallback ::For(this, args)...);

      return err;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Then we look at the implementation of MakeLibuvRequestCallback.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    // Transparently pass parameters to Libuv
    template
    struct MakeLibuvRequestCallback {
      static T For(ReqWrap * req_wrap, T v) {
        static_assert(!is_callable ::value,
                      &quot;MakeLibuvRequestCallback missed a callback&quot;);
        return v;
      }
    };

    template
    struct MakeLibuvRequestCallback {
      using F = void(*)(ReqT* req, Args... args);
      // Libuv callback static void Wrapper(ReqT* req, Args... args) {
        // Get the corresponding C++ object ReqWrap through the Libuv structure * req_wrap = ReqWrap ::from_req(req);
        req_wrap-&amp;gt;env()-&amp;gt;DecreaseWaitingRequestCounter();
        // Get the original callback and execute F original_callback = reinterpret_cast (req_wrap-&amp;gt;original_callback_);
        original_callback(req, args...);
      }

      static F For(ReqWrap * req_wrap, F v) {
        // Save the original function CHECK_NULL(req_wrap-&amp;gt;original_callback_);
        req_wrap-&amp;gt;original_callback_=
            reinterpret_cast ::callback_t&amp;gt;(v);
        // Return the wrapper function return Wrapper;
      }
    };
</code></pre>
<p>There are two cases for the implementation of MakeLibuvRequestCallback. The first of the template parameters is generally a ReqWrap subclass, and the second is generally a handle.</p>
<p>When the ReqWrap class is initialized, the number of ReqWrap instances will be recorded in the env, so as to know how many requests are being made Processed by Libuv, if the second parameter of the template parameter is a function, it means that ReqWrap is not used to request Libuv, and the second implementation is used to hijack the callback to record the number of requests being processed by Libuv (such as the implementation of GetAddrInfo). So here we are adapting the first implementation. Transparently transmit C++ layer parameters to Libuv. Let's look at Dispatch again</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">    int ReqWrap ::Dispatch(int(*)(uv_connect_t*, Args...), Args... args) {
          req_.data = this;
